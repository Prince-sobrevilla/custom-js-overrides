Privacy Policy for DevScript Injector

Last updated: October 2025

Overview

DevScript Injector is a browser extension built for developers to override, test, and debug JavaScript files in a secure environment.
This Privacy Policy explains what data the extension handles, how it is used, and the limited circumstances in which information is transmitted.

Data Collection and Use

License Key Storage
The user‚Äôs license key and toggle preferences (such as auto-inject status) are stored locally using Chrome‚Äôs secure chrome.storage API.
These values remain on the user‚Äôs device and are not shared unless license verification is triggered.

License Verification and Usage Logs
When premium features are activated, the extension sends a lightweight verification request to Airtable.
The data transmitted includes only:

The license key value

The domain where the extension was used

The timestamp of the last activity

This data is used solely to verify active licenses and monitor usage count.

No Personal or Sensitive Information Collected
DevScript Injector does not access or collect personally identifiable information, browsing history, webpage content, credentials, or any unrelated data.

Third-Party Services and APIs

Airtable ‚Äì Used only for license validation and usage logging.

GitHub and jsDelivr CDN ‚Äì Used to host developer-approved JavaScript override files.

All communications with these services occur over HTTPS to ensure encryption and integrity.

Permissions Explanation

declarativeNetRequest ‚Äì Allows controlled redirection of specific developer script URLs (e.g., testing builds).

declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess ‚Äì Grants access only to trusted developer-controlled sources (GitHub, jsDelivr, Airtable).

The extension does not access arbitrary user data or content from visited sites.

Data Retention and Deletion

Airtable stores minimal usage records (license key, domain, timestamp).
These are retained only while the license remains active.
Users may request deletion of their record by contacting the developer at the email address below.

Security Practices

All external requests use secure HTTPS endpoints.

No authentication tokens, passwords, or personal credentials are stored.

The extension runs entirely in the user‚Äôs browser sandbox and never shares data with advertisers or analytics platforms.

User Rights and Contact

Policy Updates

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect functionality changes or compliance updates.
The ‚ÄúLast Updated‚Äù date will always indicate the most recent revision.
Continued use of the extension after any update implies acceptance of the new policy.
