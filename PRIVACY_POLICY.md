# Privacy Policy for DevScript Injector
_Last updated: October 2025_

## Overview
DevScript Injector is a developer tool designed to help web developers override, test, and debug JavaScript files in a controlled and secure environment. This Privacy Policy explains how the extension handles data, what limited information it collects, and how that information is used.

---

## Data Collection and Use
- **License Key Storage**  
  Your license key is stored locally using Chromeâ€™s secure `chrome.storage` API. It never leaves your device unless you activate the extension.

- **License Verification Logs**  
  When the extension is activated, it sends license verification data to **Airtable**.  
  This includes:
  - License key value  
  - Domain where the extension was used  
  - Timestamp of last activity  

  These logs help prevent license misuse and ensure fair access to premium features.

- **No Personal or Sensitive Data**  
  The extension does **not** collect personal identifiers, browsing history, webpage content, or any data unrelated to license validation.

---

## Third-Party Services
- **Airtable** is used only for license verification and activity logging.  
- **GitHub** and **jsDelivr** are used as trusted sources for loading developer-approved script overrides.

All communication with these services occurs over HTTPS to ensure encryption and integrity.

## Data Retention
Minimal usage logs (license, domain, and timestamp) are stored on Airtable servers.  
You can request deletion of your license record by contacting us at the email below.

## Security
- No passwords or personal credentials are stored or transmitted.  
- The extension runs locally in your browser and does not share or sell data to third parties.

## Your Rights
